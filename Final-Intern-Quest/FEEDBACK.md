# CODE

In terms of the technical execution of this program, you got it to work and that IS something. It takes time to start to see these things come together I enjoyed seeing your process throughout. Some things that I think are particularly interesting:

- I noticed that you incorporate blaze as an external tool (in some parts). Usually you would probably stick to one style framework like Boostrap or Blaze but I do dig that you decided to experiment with some of this stuff and I can see that experimentation in part of this code. For the purposes of this class, I like this sort of tinkering so kudos on giving it a go.
- Partly a design issue - but you probably see that right now, your interface allows people to delete other people's things. I think this is something that you could solve given the rest of this that you have figured out. Particularly, this has to do with the way you have organized your information architecture.
- I also like how you've broken this up in to parts and components. Your choices of dividing this complex app into component parts makes sense and the name spacing and relations (parent child) also make sense here. For example, placing the editor under the parent and not as a child of an item (whereby it would be produced multiple times). Instead you pass data in once and resuse teh component which is a good design pattern.
- We've met frequently to discuss the details and issues that you've faced and I really appreciate the effort you put in toward understanding these things.
- I left you guys some gift code around the star rating system for you to chew on and think about. I think it would be interesting for you to think about how that component works including how I've designed it to be more "adaptable" to different use cases.
- I think maybe for a final submission, you could have cleaned up some of the comments and logs or edited it down to the most important parts you wanted me to read.

# DESIGN

I appreciate that you progressively step through the levels of abstraciton to build a story including the background work done to analyze the phenomenon and get to the problem. I think certain parts of this might use a little more specificity, like what exactly a personal insight is and what form it will take, etc. But in general I get the idea enough to imagine what we're building. In terms of your diagrams, I've been generally loose about how people diagram their stuff but if you do choose to use conventions, understand what squares, diamonds, and ovals mean. (Particularly diamonds - decisions - will never only have 1 in and 1 out as a choice is inherently branching.)

One question I'm leaving with several other groups is the question that goes back to the beginnings of the project. Looking back and seeing this, how it unfolded and where you ended up - do you think that the original problem is something that you and you alone can/could have solved? Do you think you solved it?

Or based on where you took the design and development, would you have done this the same way? And I don't mean technically here. I mean at a more foundational design level. I think, finding good problems is a challenging thing and choosing problems that fit our specific tools are another kind of thing as well. Through successively going through this process, we probably start to see what it means to conceive and build out our ideas and I do hope that there is some stuff you all can takeaway from the experience.
